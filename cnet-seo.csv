Currently, you’ll save up to $1,300 per aid, based on average retail prices. We’re changing an industry that often pads prices at its own discretion.

This is a common question because our memberships are only available to members of participating health plans. Rather, TruHearing is an independent savings program. It is possible, however, to use insurance coverage for hearing aids together with TruHearing’s low, contracted prices. When you make your first appointment with TruHearing, we’ll gather your healthcare plan information and help you apply any benefits you may have.</p><div class=""quote_bubble tall""><div class=""inner""><p><span>did you know:</span> Because we are not insurance, the low, contracted pricing can be combined with some health plan hearing benefits.
